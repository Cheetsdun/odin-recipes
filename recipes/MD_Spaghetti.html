<h2>In Million Dollar Spaghetti, the ricotta layer lends an overall creamy texture, 
    but it’s not too heavy or rich. A thick layer of meat sauce keeps everything loose.
     (If you’ve had a dry spaghetti bake, you’ll know what we mean.) 
    Did we mention there's cheese? Four kinds of cheese are in this spaghetti 
    casserole so that every bite is ooey and gooey.</h2>

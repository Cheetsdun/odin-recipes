<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>In Million Dollar Spaghetti, the ricotta layer lends an overall creamy texture, 
    but it’s not too heavy or rich. A thick layer of meat sauce keeps everything loose.
     (If you’ve had a dry spaghetti bake, you’ll know what we mean.) 
    Did we mention there's cheese? Four kinds of cheese are in this spaghetti 
    casserole so that every bite is ooey and gooey.</p>

    <h3>Million Dollar Spaghetti ingredients</h3>
  
    <ul>
<li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: You can use another pasta if you want, 
    but the way the long, thin spaghetti 
    noodles press together 
    and bake really makes the texture of this casserole special.</li>
<li><strong>Ground sirloin and ground sausage</strong> Feel free to use all of 
    one kind of meat—or even reach for ground turkey or ground chicken as an 
    alternative. The sausage and beef are a bit richer, 
    but you'll never know the difference in the final dish.</li>
<li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>To add flavor and aromatics. </li>
<li><strong>Marinara nauce</strong> 
    We prefer 
    Rao's for its brightness 
    and fresh flavor, 
    but any will work so long as you like it.</li>
<li><strong>Butter</strong> 
    Covering the spaghetti in a bit of 
    marinara and butter helps to avoid it turning dry while baking.</li>
    <Li><strong>Cream cheese </strong> 
        This forms the base of 
        the creamy cheese layer.  You could use more ricotta, 
        or reach for flavored cream cheese, like garlic and herb.</Li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> 
            This adds a lot of richness without too much 
            flavor. Some people prefer cottage cheese 
            ver ricotta, and that's a good swap if you happen to 
            have cottage cheese already.</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>
                This finishes the 
                three-cheese layer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong>
                Top the spaghetti casserole with 
                mozzarella that will turn bubbly and golden in the oven.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Parsley</strong>
                Fresh parsley 
                is a nice touch 
                to finish off the dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><i>Directions:</i></h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare oven and pan:</strong>
            Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 9- x 13-inch 
            baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</li></strong>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add spaghetti, 
            and cook according to package directions.
            <li><strong>Make the meat sauce:</strong>
                While pasta cooks, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. 
                Add ground sirloin and sausage. Cook, breaking up meat into smaller 
                pieces with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until meat is 
                browned and no longer pink, about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add onion and garlic:</strong>
                Add onion and garlic to meat mixture; 
                cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add marinara:</strong>
                Stir 3 1/2 cups of the marinara into meat 
                mixture. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add butter and marinara to pasta:</strong>
                Add butter and remaining 1/2 cup marinara to pasta in pot.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make cheese mixture:</strong>
                Stir together cream cheese, ricotta, and Parmesan in a small 
                bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add meat sauce:</strong>
                Top pasta mixture with meat sauce.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the spaghetti:</strong>
                Bake in preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is golden, 
                about 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.
            </li>

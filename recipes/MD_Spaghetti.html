<p>In Million Dollar Spaghetti, the ricotta layer lends an overall creamy texture, 
    but it’s not too heavy or rich. A thick layer of meat sauce keeps everything loose.
     (If you’ve had a dry spaghetti bake, you’ll know what we mean.) 
    Did we mention there's cheese? Four kinds of cheese are in this spaghetti 
    casserole so that every bite is ooey and gooey.</p>

    <h3>Million Dollar Spaghetti ingredients</h3>
  
    <ul>
<li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: You can use another pasta if you want, 
    but the way the long, thin spaghetti 
    noodles press together 
    and bake really makes the texture of this casserole special.</li>
<li><strong>Ground sirloin and ground sausage</strong> Feel free to use all of 
    one kind of meat—or even reach for ground turkey or ground chicken as an 
    alternative. The sausage and beef are a bit richer, 
    but you'll never know the difference in the final dish.</li>
<li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>To add flavor and aromatics. </li>
<li><strong>Marinara nauce</strong> 
    We prefer 
    Rao's for its brightness 
    and fresh flavor, 
    but any will work so long as you like it.</li>
<li><strong>Butter</strong> 
    Covering the spaghetti in a bit of 
    marinara and butter helps to avoid it turning dry while baking.</li>
    <Li><strong>Cream cheese </strong> 
        This forms the base of 
        the creamy cheese layer.  You could use more ricotta, 
        or reach for flavored cream cheese, like garlic and herb.</Li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> 
            This adds a lot of richness without too much 
            flavor. Some people prefer cottage cheese 
            ver ricotta, and that's a good swap if you happen to 
            have cottage cheese already.</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>
                This finishes the 
                three-cheese layer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong>
                Top the spaghetti casserole with 
                mozzarella that will turn bubbly and golden in the oven.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Parsley</strong>
                Fresh parsley 
                is a nice touch 
                to finish off the dish.</li>
